Functionality:
- Option to show English translation (maybe add option to hide translation? ie go back to original)
- inreasing difficulty algorithm
- Keep score? (make start over if score gets below zero?)
    (store lastIndex and make sure current is not equal to last?) --something like a hashmap would be good for that
- Change language option

Graphic design:

Data:
- Add words to list (with increasing difficulty each time).

Misc.:

Slowly increasing difficulty
points =/= lives
if points == 0 && wrong, lives -= 1;

possible levels (when you reach a certain point)
