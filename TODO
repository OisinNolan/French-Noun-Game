Functionality:
- Option to show English translation (maybe add option to hide translation? ie go back to original)âˆš
- increasing difficulty algorithm  --have a possible solution for this, will show you tomorrow (Sophie)
- Keep score? (make start over if score gets below zero?)
    (store lastIndex and make sure current is not equal to last?) --something like a hashmap would be good for that
- Change language option
- when you answer multiple questions in quick succession, the 'incorrect'/'correct' button
  fades out multiple times all in one go afterwards. Maybe change that?

Graphic design:

Data:

Misc.:

Slowly increasing difficulty
